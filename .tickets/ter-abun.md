# Make GpuTimingTests.APassThatRecordsNothing stable under load: it measured 0.127 ms against 0.05 ms once

Found in ter-izsu (2026-10-26): GpuTimingTests.APassThatRecordsNothingReportsTheTimeItTookWhichIsNearlyZero failed once while other agents built and traced on the machine: the empty pass took 0.127 ms against the test's bound of 0.05 ms. A pass's stamp time includes any idle time before it (ARCHITECTURE.md, 'GPU timings'), so a busy GPU can stretch it. Find a bound or a measure (for example the fewest of several frames, as Allocations.Fewest does for the allocation tests) that holds under load and still fails when an empty pass records work.

## Acceptance Criteria

The test passes in 20 runs of the Rendering tests in a row while another process renders, and still fails when the empty pass is made to record a dispatch.


## Notes

**2026-10-27T02:41:53Z**

2026-10-26 (ter-okrp): the flake is probably the late stamp on MoltenVK: the empty pass's time can hold part of the next pass's work (ARCHITECTURE.md, 'GPU timings'). A bound that holds under load may need to read the pass beside it, or the test may hold only on drivers whose stamps do not latch late (VulkanRenderer.StampsLatchLate).
