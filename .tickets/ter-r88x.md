# GPU lock: record its holder, so that no other process can release it

Found in ter-q58r on 2026-11-04: during one timed run, tools/gpu-lock.sh printed "rmdir: failed to remove '/tmp/tertius-gpu-measure.lock': No such file or directory". Another process removed the lock while this run held it, so two timed runs could share the GPU without knowing. The lock is a bare directory (mkdir to take, rmdir to release). tools/gpu-lock.sh is the one helper on main, but agents also take it by hand (mkdir/rmdir in their briefs) and spike scripts on branches take it (tools/sftw/top-run.sh, gpu-locked.sh). Nothing records who holds the lock, so a release cannot check that it is its own, and a stale lock after a crash has no owner to test. Fix: the lock directory holds its holder's PID and start time; release removes it only if it is the caller's; a waiting taker can clear a lock whose holder process is gone. Every brief and tool takes the lock only through tools/gpu-lock.sh (or a small take/release form of it for runs that span several commands).


## Notes

**2026-11-04T17:30:08Z**

2026-11-04: cause of the incident found. The ter-9nrc hardening agent ran its own mkdir of the lock and an rmdir after ';' in one command line. The mkdir failed because ter-q58r held the lock, and the rmdir still ran and removed ter-q58r's lock. ter-q58r's first try (round 3 base, /private/tmp/q58r-fsr-timing) ran its last seconds without the lock; its acceptance used the second try. So the class of bug is a release that does not check ownership; a lock that records its holder makes it impossible.
