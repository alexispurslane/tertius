# Tools

These helpers start JetBrains Rider inside the dev shell, and run code coverage and Stryker.NET mutation testing on the lines that a branch changed. For the rules on which helper to run, read the Testing section of CLAUDE.md. The scripts are tool code: they never ship, so they skip polish.

Run every command in the dev shell, from the repository root. The build copies the Jolt library and the Vulkan loader next to each output, so the tests need no `DYLD_*` variable. Outside the dev shell, the GPU tests cannot find `libvulkan`, and the scripts stop with a message. Write the output to a folder outside the repository, for example `/tmp/tertius-coverage`.

## JetBrains Rider

Rider must use the dev shell's .NET SDK and variables. If you open the project from the Dock, Rider uses an SDK of its own and cannot find the Jolt library or Vulkan. `tools/rider.sh` starts Rider inside the dev shell. It also keeps `.nix/dotnet-sdk`, a stable link to the dev shell's SDK. The link is also a root for the Nix garbage collector, so the SDK stays in the store.

1. Quit Rider. A running Rider opens the folder with its own variables, and the script stops with a message.
2. Start Rider from the repository root:

   ```bash
   bash tools/rider.sh
   ```

3. Do this step once. In Rider, open Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Toolset and Build. Set ".NET CLI executable path" to `.nix/dotnet-sdk/share/dotnet/dotnet` in the repository, as an absolute path. Then set "MSBuild version" to the MSBuild of that SDK.
4. Do this step once. In Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Unit Testing, turn on the support for Microsoft.Testing.Platform. The test projects use it (see `global.json`).

Start Rider with the script every time. When the flake changes the SDK, the script moves the link, and the setting of step 3 stays correct.

The build copies the Jolt library and the Vulkan loader next to each output, from `TERTIUS_JOLTC_DIR` and `TERTIUS_VULKAN_DIR`. macOS removes `DYLD_*` variables from Rider, because Rider has the hardened runtime, so a test that Rider starts never sees `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`. The loader finds MoltenVK through `VK_ICD_FILENAMES`, which Rider keeps.

## Coverage on changed lines

1. Run every test project with coverage, in both build configurations:

   ```bash
   nix develop --command bash -c 'bash tools/coverage/run.sh /tmp/tertius-coverage Debug Release'
   ```

2. Print the coverage of the lines that this branch changed in `src/`, against `main`:

   ```bash
   nix develop --command bash -c 'python3 tools/coverage/changed-lines.py /tmp/tertius-coverage/Debug /tmp/tertius-coverage/Release'
   ```

If either configuration covers a line, the line counts as covered. Debug covers the contracts, and Release covers the code behind `#if !DEBUG`. The script lists the files with the most uncovered lines first, with the uncovered lines and the lines whose branches are only partly covered.

## Mutation testing with Stryker.NET

1. Write a configuration for one source project. Name the test projects that exercise it:

   ```bash
   nix develop --command bash -c 'python3 tools/stryker/config.py --project Core --tests Core Simulation Physics --out /tmp/tertius-stryker/Core'
   ```

   By default, the configuration mutates only the lines that this branch changed. To mutate whole files, add `--files` with paths relative to the project folder, for example `--files Frames/FrameTree.cs`.

2. Run Stryker on that project:

   ```bash
   nix develop --command bash -c 'bash tools/stryker/run.sh Core /tmp/tertius-stryker/Core'
   ```

3. List the mutants that no test caught, and the mutants in the spans that did not compile:

   ```bash
   nix develop --command bash -c 'python3 tools/stryker/survivors.py /tmp/tertius-stryker/Core/out/reports/mutation-report.json --config /tmp/tertius-stryker/Core/stryker-config.json'
   ```

Triage each mutant in the list as the `test-hardening` skill says: kill it with a test, or mark it equivalent with a one-sentence reason in a Stryker ignore comment.

Break each line with a mutant that did not compile by hand. Run the tests that cover the line. Then restore the line. Some of those mutants are invalid, for example `*` to `/` on a quaternion type that has no `/`. Skip those.

## Stryker.NET pitfalls

These cost time on the vertical slice, so the scripts handle them:

- Stryker.NET 5.0.0 reads `coverage-analysis` only from a configuration file, not from the command line. Without `perTest`, every mutant runs every test.
- Stryker.NET matches a `mutate` pattern against the full path. A pattern without the `**/` prefix matches no file, and the run then has no mutants.
- In a pattern such as `**/Frames/FrameTree.cs{402..1704}`, the numbers are character offsets in the file, not line numbers.
- Stryker.NET leaves a mutant that does not compile out of the score. A method with a pattern variable in a condition, such as `x is { } box && ...`, often makes every mutant in the method fail to compile (error CS0165). On the vertical slice, the Core score was 100% of 155 mutants, but 52 more mutants never ran. Hand mutations of their lines found three gaps.
- The progress bar shows only on a terminal. The `-L` flag writes the log to `out/logs`, so that you can follow a run in the background.

Do not run two Stryker runs at once, and do not run Stryker in subagents. Two runs compete for the CPU, and their tests time out.
